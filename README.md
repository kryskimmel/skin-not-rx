<h2 id="about-section">ABOUT</h2>

*Skin-not-Rx* is an app designed to keep track of every skincare product you haveâ€” currently and previously. With its simplistic user interface, you can easily add your products and skincare routines in a collection that describes them best. Not sure which product to implement into your routine? Then why not get a random recommendation using the random product generator. Curious to see what products or routines others have? You can explore that too! Keeping track of what products you have, products you've loved, and products that you wouldn't bother purchasing again shouldn't be hard... and those are the conveniences that *Skin-not-Rx* aims to provide.
